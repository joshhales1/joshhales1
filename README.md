Hi, I’m Josh Hales.

I've been building websites for many years with experience in social media, e-commerce and functional web apps. I also enjoy game development but enjoy game engines more.

I’m currently doing a lot of JavaScript and TypeScript building cool SPAs. I'm also delving into circuitry for an even lower level understanding.

I have experience in C#, JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, PHP, HTML, CSS and a variety of operating systems.

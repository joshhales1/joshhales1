Hi, I’m Josh Hales.

I've been building websites for many years with experience in social media, e-commerce and functional web apps. I also enjoy game development but enjoy game engines more.

I’m currently doing a lot of JavaScript and TypeScript building cool SPAs. I'm also delving into circuitry for an even lower level understanding.

I have experience in C#, JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, PHP, HTML, CSS and a variety of operating systems.

Check out my website at [jayhal.es](https://jayhal.es/) or email me at <a href="mailto:me@jayhal.es" target="_blank">me@jayhal.es</a>.

Currently working at HWD.

That weird PFP is some AI generated thing, I think it looks cool...
